        <p>Our restaurant probably has the finest
            wall paper you will ever see. They're really old!
            Once we had a guest saying the walls made him question
            his career (he was an carpenter). He honestly sat
            by the fireplace next to our bar and went on
            and on about how working full time as a wall felt
            more in the lines of how he saw himself on the inside (he touched
            his chest right where he presumed the heart was and looked deep
            into a list of emergency phone numbers).
            "What had happened?", he said. "When I was that little kid
            running around in Vladvostock (yes, he travelled far) I never dreamed
            about nails, glue or hammers!" Sure enough that guy came around the day after,
            kept his job and so forth. The point is
            though, you now have a clear picture of what to expect when
            eating at our restaurant. We look forward to your visit!
