            <p> Lagos Golf Club is probably the finest
                golf club you will ever visit. The greens are so
                green they make Camp Nou look like a sad Christmas tree.
                Once we had a guest saying the fairways made him question
                his career as an investment banker. He sat
                by the fireplace next to our bar and went on
                and on about how working full time as a green keeper felt
                more in the lines of how he saw himself on the inside (he touched
                his chest right where he presumed his heart was and looked deep
                into a painting of a local lake).
                "What had happened?", he said. "When I was that little kid
                running around Boston (yes, he had travelled far) I never dreamt
                about shorting stocks or screaming with a landline telephone in
                my hand!" Sure enough he came around the day after, I mean
                he was making ALOT of money so morals or values wasn't really an issue. So, you now have a clear picture
                of what to expect when
                visiting us. We look forward to your visit!
